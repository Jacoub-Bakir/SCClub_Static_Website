# 🚀 Start Coding Club - Static Website 🌐

## 📝 Description

The "Start Coding Club - Static Website" is my first web development project. As a passionate learner in the world of programming, I wanted to create a platform to showcase our club's activities and engage with fellow coding enthusiasts.

This static website serves as a digital hub for "Start Coding Club," where visitors can explore information about our club, upcoming events, past achievements, and resources for learning. The project's primary goal is to apply my web development knowledge and skills, emphasizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in a real-world scenario.

Building this website has been a rewarding journey as I honed my web development expertise, delved into responsive design principles, and embraced the power of interactivity using JavaScript. The website not only represents our club's identity but also reflects my commitment to continuous learning and growth as a web developer.

I invite you to explore the "Start Coding Club - Static Website" and share in our passion for coding!
